## ✨ Features

- 🎲 **Full dice-driven generation.** Every result comes from the book tables, with modifiers carried from one roll to the next.
- 🔁 **Roll again.** Each page has a button that rolls a brand-new settlement without leaving the page.
- 📊 **Information card.** Lists every applied modifier and every die roll (die, result, modifier and total) behind the result.
- ✦ **Extras.** Encounters, rumors, taverns (Tavern Builder), local production, scene details, adventure hooks and personnel issues. Extra terms are highlighted and open a description when clicked.
- 🗺️ **Fortress figures.** Keeps, castles and strongholds include reference drawings for plans, walls and layouts.
- 💾 **TXT export.** Download everything shown on the page, including the Information summary and the extras you rolled.
- 🌐 **Bilingual.** Click the Brazil or UK/USA flag in the footer. Your choice is remembered, the browser language is the default (English if unknown), and switching language replays the *same* roll in the other language.

> The rules and tables follow the book *Spectacular Settlements*. Keeps, castles and strongholds are cumulative: a castle includes a keep, and a stronghold includes both.

## 🚀 Running locally

The shared header and footer are loaded with `fetch`, so the site must be served over HTTP instead of opening the HTML files directly:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## 🧩 How it works

- **Shared layout.** Each page reserves `#site-header` and `#site-footer`; `js/layout.js` fills them from `components/`.
- **Information card.** `js/generation-info.js` must load before the generator script. Generators call its `rollDie` and `logMod` helpers so every roll and modifier can be listed.
- **Translations.** Display text in the generator scripts is wrapped as `__("English text")`, and `js/lang/pt-book.js` maps each English string to Portuguese. Generation uses a seeded random number generator, so reloading with the same seed in another language gives the same roll. Rolls must never depend on translated text.
